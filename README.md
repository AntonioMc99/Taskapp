Making this task app was fun but also kind of hard. The hardest part for me was figuring out JavaScript, especially getting the tasks to show up and update on the page. Things like event listeners, local storage, and comparing dates were pretty confusing at first. I had to take a lot of breaks and try things step by step just to make sure I didn’t break something every time I added new code. Once I got the hang of it, it started to make more sense. If I had more time, I’d add a delete button, maybe a dark mode, and make the app look better on phones. Even though JavaScript is really tricky, I’m proud of what I was able to build.
